    <h2 style="color: blue;"><i>10 Best Ways to Reduce Air Pollution:</i></h2><br>
    <div class="container-fluid imp1-row">
        <img src="PublicTransport.jpeg" class="images img-fluid img-responsive round" alt="PublicTransport">
        <h3 style="color: brown;"><li><i>Using public transports:</i></li></h3><br>
 <p style="color: orange;">Using public transport is a sure short way of contributing to less air pollution as it provides with less gas and energy, even carpools contribute to it. 
In addition to less release of fuels and gas, using a public transport can also help in saving money.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid  imp1-row"><br>
<img src="TurnOffLight.jpeg" class="images1 img-responsive round" alt="TurnOffLight">
<h3 style="color: magenta;"><li><i>Turn off the lights when not in use:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: green;">The energy that the lights take also contribute to air pollution, thus less consumption of electricity can save energy. 
    Use energy saving fluorescent lights to help the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="RRR.jpeg" class="images img-responsive round" alt="RRR">
<h3 style="color: blue;"><li><i>Recycle and Reuse:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: red;">The concept of recycle and reuse is not just conserve resources and use them judicially but also is helpful for air pollution as it helps in reducing pollution emissions. 
    The recycled products also take less power to make other products.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="NoToPlastic.jpeg" class="images1 img-responsive round" alt="NoToPlastic">
<h3 style="color: orange;"><li><i>No to plastic bags:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: magenta;">The use of plastic products could be very harmful to the environment as they take a very long time to decompose, due to their material made up of oil. 
    The use of paper bags instead is a better alternative as they decompose easily and are recyclable.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="ForestFires.jpeg" class="images img-responsive round" alt="ForestFires">
<h3 style="color: green;"><li><i>Reduction of forest fires and smoking:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: brown;">The collecting of garbage and getting it on fire in dry seasons or dry leaves catching fires is a huge factor for causing air pollution, 
    moreover smoking also causes air pollution and causes the air quality to worsen along with obviously damaging one’s health.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="Fans.jpeg" class="images1 img-responsive round" alt="Fans">
<h3 style="color: red;"><li><i>Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: magenta;">The usage of AC’s takes a lot of energy and emits a lot of heat which is bad for the environment.
     AC’s also take a lot of power and energy to work as compared to fans.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="ChimneyFilter.jpeg" class="images img-responsive round" alt="ChimneyFilter">
<h3 style="color: blue;"><li><i>Use filters for chimneys:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: goldenrod;">The gas that is emitted from fireplaces in homes and factories are extremely dangerous for air pollution and harms the air quality severely. 
    The use of filters should be used at least if the consumption couldn’t be lessened, this will help to reduce the effect of harmful gases absorbing in the air.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="NoToCrackers.jpeg" class="images1 img-responsive round" alt="NoToCrackers">
<h3 style="color: green;"><li><i>Avoid usage of crackers:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: brown;">The use of crackers during festivals and weddings is sadly one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, leading to a layer of smog which is extremely harmful for health.
     So, practice of no crackers should be implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="Organic.jpeg" class="images img-responsive round" alt="Organic">
<h3 style="color: orange;"><li><i>Avoid using of products with chemicals:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: blue;">Products that use the chemicals in their usage or smell strongly, like paints or perfumes should be used less or outside the house.
     There can also be an alternative to use products with low chemical content and organic properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid imp-row">
<img src="Afforestation.jpeg" class="images1 img-responsive round" alt="Afforestation">
<h3 style="color: magenta;"><li><i>Implement Afforestation:</i></li></h3><br>
<p style="color: green;">Last but not the least, plant and grow as many trees as possible. The practice of planting trees provides a lot of benefits 
    to the environment and helps with the release of oxygen.</p>

    <span><h3 style="color: red;"><i>Five Indian Innovations To Beat Air Pollution:</i></h3><br>
        <h5 class="heading3" style="color: goldenrod;"><i>– By René Van Berkel, Representative to India of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization</i></h5></span><br>
    <p style="color: green;">Did you know that nine out of ten people everywhere in the world breathe dirty air?
       Air pollution affects everyone rich or poor, old or young, man or woman, urban or rural. 
       It’s a problem that cannot be dealt with in isolation; just like the causes of air pollution are many and varied, the solutions need to be too. We need out-of-the-box ideas to tackle air pollution. 
       India is a petri dish of innovation, and here are five innovations to Beat Air Pollution.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: orange;"><i>1. A Revolution from Pollution</i></h4><br>
<p style="color: brown;">Delhi-based Chakr Innovation curbs air pollution with the world’s first retro-fit emission control device for diesel generators. 
It captures 90% of particulate matter emissions from the exhaust air without reducing energy efficiency. The diesel soot captured from the exhaust is converted into inks and paints.</p><br>
<h4 style="color: blue;"><i>2. Solar Ferry</i></h4><br>
<p style="color: magenta;">ADITYA, India’s first solar ferry, built by NavAlt Solar & Electric Boats, brings together innovation in naval design and engineering, solar power and advanced controls. 
It is India’s first commercially viable solar-powered ferry. The 75 seater ferry gets over 80% of its energy from the sun and can cruise over 6 hours on a sunny day.</p><br>
<h4 style="color: green;"><i>3. CleanTech for Health and Clean Air</i></h4><br>
<p style="color: red;">Cellzyme Biotech from Coimbatore uses an engineered enzyme to make antibiotics at room temperature without using solvents – a main contributor to air quality. 
The novel production process reduces the environmental footprint by replacing harsh industrial chemicals and conserving energy.</p><br>
<h4 style="color: brown;"><i>4. Cooking with Radiant Heat</i></h4><br>
<p style="color: goldenrod;">Inspired by the traditional Indian method of cooking on charcoal, Agnisumukh manufactures commercial kitchen equipment driven by innovative, energy efficient radiant heat gas burners. 
These ultra-efficient cooking stoves save 30% on gas, improve cooking and help beat indoor air pollution in commercial kitchens.</p><br>
<h4 style="color: magenta;"><i>5. Biomedical Waste Management</i></h4><br>
<p style="color: blue;">There are microwaves now available in the Indian market to treat infectious waste and eliminate air emissions, 
including toxic POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants) – toxic chemicals that adversely affect human health and the environment around the world.</p><br>
