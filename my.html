              <h2>Why Trees Are So Important?</h2>
              <p class="bio-tree"> Trees help  filter to the air we breath and water we drink.Except for relaxing, connecting us with nature and their calming effect, trees do a lot when it comes to the environment.Keep reading to find out what trees do for our environment

                <h3>AIR</h3>
                <p>Have you ever felt that feeling of â€œpure airâ€œ in the forest or in woods ? Well, you were right because it is well known that trees do purify the air. They absorb pollutant gases such as nitrogen oxides, ozone, ammonia, sulfur dioxide.Increasing levels of carbon dioxide caused by deforestation and fossil fuel combustion trap heat in the atmosphere.Healthy, strong trees act as carbon sinks, reducing the effects of climate change.</p>

                <h3>WATER</h3>
                <p>Trees act as natural pollution filters for water .They play a key role in capturing rainwater and reducing the risk of natural disasters like floods and landslides. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.According to the UN Food and Agriculture Association, a mature evergreen tree can intercept more than 15,000 litres of water every year.

                <h3>WILDLIFE</h3>
                <p>Trees support the lives of many large organisms.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.During times of extreme heat or precipitation, animals seek shade and shelter under the trees without being away from their food source; the shade helps them regulate their body temperatures.Without trees, forest creatures would have nowhere to call home.

                <h3>CLIMATE</h3>
                <p>If people are good at something, then it is building up excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Harmful CO2 contributes to climate change, the biggest current problem the world has to deal with. Trees, however, help fight it.With more than 50% of the worldâ€™s population living in cities ,a number expected to increase to 66% by the year 2050 ,pollution and overheating are becoming a real threat.

                <h3>HEALTH</h3>
                <p>Did you know that hospital patients with rooms of view with trees recover faster than those without the same view? Itâ€™s impossible to ignore that feeling of elation you get while walking through a calm, quiet forest. A mature acre of trees can yearly provide oxygen for 18 people.A study in the Journal of Preventative Medicine found that people experienced more deaths from heart disease and respiratory disease when they lived in areas where trees had disappeared .

                <h3>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h3>
                <p>Conservation should improve the livelihoods of local people.The job opportunities provided by the forestry industry are endless. We donâ€™t just rely on trees for work, though. Sustainable tree farming provides timber to build homes and shelters, and wood to burn for cooking and heating. Food-producing trees provide fruit, nuts, berries, and leaves for consumption by both humans and animals, and pack a powerful nutritional punch.  </p>
