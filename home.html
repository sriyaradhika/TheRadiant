            <h2>Importance of Environment :</h2>
            <p class="div1Text">Our environment provides a wide range of benefits, such as the air we breathe, the water we drink 
               and the land we cultivate for food, as well as the many materials needed in our homes, 
               at work and for leisure activities. Environment plays a vital role in keeping living things healthy in the environment. 
               Likewise, it maintains the ecological balance that will keep check of life on earth.
               Moreover, the entire life support of humans depends wholly on the environmental factors. 
               In addition, it also helps in maintaining various life cycles on earth. Most importantly, 
               our environment is the source of natural beauty and is necessary for maintaining physical and mental health.

            <h2>What is happening to our Mother Earth :</h2>
            <p class="div2Text">
                Our Mother Earth is currently facing a lot of environmental concerns. Over the last few decades, the 
                exploitation of our planet and the degradation of our environment has gone up at an alarming rate. 
                As our actions have been not in favor of protecting this planet, we have seen natural disasters striking us 
                more often in the form of flash floods, earthquakes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones. Different environmental 
                groups around the world play their role in educating people as to how their small actions, when combined 
                together, can play a big role in protecting this planet.
